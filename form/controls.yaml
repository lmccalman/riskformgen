# controls.yaml — Safeguards that reduce assessed risk when present.
#
# Each control is linked to a question. It is "present" when the question's
# answer matches present_value (exact match for single-select, membership
# check for multi-select).
#
# Effects list which risks are reduced, and in which dimension:
#   reduces_likelihood:  true — drops likelihood by one step on the scale
#   reduces_consequence: true — drops consequence by one step on the scale
# At least one of these must be true per effect.
